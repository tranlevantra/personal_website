    "text": "🧠 MATH\nI’m a nerd — no doubt about it. But I have an explanation. Some people hit the gym to stay fit; I originally started solving math problems to keep my brain agile and sharp. And it’s funny — the more you do it, the more you want to do it. That’s how I ended up here.\nThe kind of math I study is statistics — not pure math, but a mathematical science nonetheless. I absolutely adore 📘 Statistical Inference by Casella and Berger, and I have set my sights on 📗 Probability and Measure by Patrick Billingsley.\nI feel incredibly grateful to study math at this level. And as cliché as it sounds: the more I learn, the more I realize how little I actually know.\nBecause data science is trending — and statistics is its backbone — here are some resources on data science math (tested and approved by a nerd 🤓):\n\n📐 Calculus:\n\nBook: Calculus by James Stewart\n\nCourse: MIT OpenCourseWare\n\nSingle Variable Calculus\n\nMultivariable Calculus\n\n\nA fun, intuitive approach: Khan Academy\n\nIntegral Calculus\n\nDifferential Calculus\n\nMultivariable Calculus\n\n\n\n\n📊 Linear Algebra:\n\nBook: Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang\n\nCourse: MIT OCW 18.06 Linear Algebra\n\nVisual & intuitive: Math for Game Devs by Freya Holmer — she’s so cute, love her 😍"

    "text": "💻 CODING\nI’m still new to coding — and feel so lucky that auto-completion, Copilot, and ChatGPT were already around when I began.\nMy favorite language so far is Java — it’s declarative, easy to read, and has just the right amount of strictness to catch bugs early. But the language I’m most fluent in is R, because I study Statistics — and R was developed by statisticians, for statisticians 📈.\nArguing about which programming language is “better” feels a bit pointless to me. Languages are tools, and each serves a different purpose. What matters is what you build with them.\nI do wish I’d taken Data Structures and Algorithms when I was in school — It’s all good, there is an abundance of amazing online resources now. 📚💻"

My parents work really hard to provide for us, and as the oldest sister, I naturally found myself in the kitchen early on.\nThings really leveled up when I moved to Australia — I began cooking exquisite Vietnamese dishes to share my culture with new friends, soothe homesickness, and explore cuisines from around the world.\nMy inspiration? This lovely collection from VnExpress. It’s in Vietnamese, but three things transcend all language barriers — love, music, and yes… food! ❤️🎶🍲"
