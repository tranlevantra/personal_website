## 🧠 MATH

I’m a nerd — no doubt about it. But I have an explanation. Some people hit the gym to stay fit; I originally started solving math problems to keep my brain agile and sharp. And it’s funny — the more you do it, the more you *want* to do it. That’s how I ended up here.

The kind of math I study is **statistics** — not pure math, but a mathematical science nonetheless. I absolutely adore 📘 [*Statistical Inference* by Casella and Berger](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-Second-Roger-Casella/dp/0534243126), and I have set my sights on 📗 [*Probability and Measure* by Patrick Billingsley](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/billingsley.pdf).  

I feel incredibly grateful to study math at this level. And as cliché as it sounds: the more I learn, the more I realize how little I actually know.

Because data science is trending — and statistics is its backbone — here are some resources on *data science math* (tested and approved by a nerd 🤓):

### 📐 Calculus:
- Book: [*Calculus* by James Stewart](https://github.com/taivu312/books/tree/master/mathematics/calculus/stewart_calculus)  
- Course: MIT OpenCourseWare  
  - [Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)  
  - [Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)  
- A fun, intuitive approach: Khan Academy  
  - [Integral Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus)  
  - [Differential Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus)  
  - [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)  

### 📊 Linear Algebra:
- Book: *Linear Algebra* by Gilbert Strang  
- Course: [MIT OCW 18.06 Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)  
- Visual & intuitive: [*Math for Game Devs*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLImQaTpSAdsArRFFj8bIfqMk2X7Vlf3XF) by Freya Holmer — she’s so cute, love her 😍

## 💻 CODING

I’m still new to coding — and feel so lucky that auto-completion, Copilot, and ChatGPT were already around when I began.

My favorite language so far is **Java** — it’s declarative, easy to read, and has just the right amount of strictness to catch bugs early. But the language I’m most fluent in is **R**, because I study Statistics — and R was developed *by statisticians, for statisticians* 📈.

Arguing about which programming language is "better" feels a bit pointless to me. Languages are tools, and each serves a different purpose. What matters is what you build with them.

I do wish I’d taken **Data Structures and Algorithms** when I was in school — It's all good, there is an abundance of amazing online resources now. 📚💻

## 🍜 COOKING

My cooking journey began a long time ago. My parents work really hard to provide for us, and as the oldest sister, I naturally found myself in the kitchen early on.

Things really leveled up when I moved to Australia — I began cooking *exquisite Vietnamese dishes* to share my culture with new friends, soothe homesickness, and explore cuisines from around the world.

My [inspiration](https://vnexpress.net/doi-song/cooking/thuc-don)? This lovely collection from VnExpress. It’s in Vietnamese, but three things transcend all language barriers — love, music, and yes... food! ❤️🎶🍲
